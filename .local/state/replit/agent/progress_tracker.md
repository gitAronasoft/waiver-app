## Session 5 (October 27, 2025) - OTP Verification Bug Fix:

[x] 31. Identified OTP verification issue with phone number masking
[x] 32. Fixed NewCustomerForm.js to strip mask from phone number before backend submission
[x] 33. Restarted React App workflow to apply fix

### Bug Fix Details:
**Problem:** OTP verification was failing for new customer waivers because:
- Phone numbers were being stored in database with mask format: `(123) 456-7890`
- But OTP verification was checking for clean format: `1234567890`
- This caused phone number mismatch and verification failures

**Solution:** Modified `NewCustomerForm.js` (lines 206-210):
- Added `const cleanPhone = stripMask(formData.cell_phone)` to extract digits only
- Changed `fullData` to send `cell_phone: cleanPhone` instead of masked format
- Now phone numbers are consistently stored as clean 10-digit numbers

**Impact:**
‚úÖ OTP verification now works correctly for new customer waivers
‚úÖ Phone number format is consistent between storage and verification
‚úÖ No changes needed to existing customer flow (already working correctly)
‚úÖ Backend OTP matching logic works as expected

### Testing Notes:
- Backend logs confirmed the issue: stored `(788) 834-2216` but verified `7888342216`
- Fix ensures all phone numbers are stored as clean digits: `7888342216`
- Old OTP records with masked format will expire naturally (5 minute TTL)

**BUG FIXED: OTP verification now working correctly! ‚úì**

## Session 5 (October 27, 2025) - Complete Phone Number Audit & Fixes:

[x] 34. Audited all database tables storing phone numbers (customers, otps)
[x] 35. Reviewed all frontend components using phone masking (3 components)
[x] 36. Verified all backend endpoints handling phone numbers (5 endpoints)
[x] 37. Created comprehensive documentation file (PHONE_NUMBER_HANDLING.md)

### Complete Phone Number Audit Results:

**Database Tables:**
‚úÖ `customers` table: `cell_phone`, `home_phone`, `work_phone` columns - Should store clean digits
‚úÖ `otps` table: `phone` column - Should store clean digits

**Frontend Components:**
1. ‚úÖ **NewCustomerForm.js** - FIXED (already done in task #32)
   - Strips mask before sending to backend
2. ‚úÖ **ExistingCustomerLogin.js** - ALREADY CORRECT
   - Already strips mask before API calls
3. ‚úÖ **ConfirmCustomerInfo.js** - ALREADY CORRECT
   - Already strips mask before update

**Backend Endpoints:**
1. ‚úÖ POST `/api/waivers` (createWaiver) - Correctly stores clean phone
2. ‚úÖ POST `/api/waivers/update-customer` (updateCustomer) - Correctly stores clean phone
3. ‚úÖ POST `/api/auth/send-otp` (sendOtp) - Correctly handles clean phone
4. ‚úÖ POST `/api/auth/verify-otp` (verifyOtp) - Correctly matches clean phone
5. ‚úÖ GET `/api/waivers/customer-info` (getCustomerInfo) - Correctly queries clean phone

### Documentation Created:
üìÑ **PHONE_NUMBER_HANDLING.md** - Comprehensive guide including:
- Database schema for all phone-related columns
- Frontend component handling with examples
- Backend endpoint documentation
- Best practices and code patterns
- Testing checklist
- Maintenance guidelines

### Key Findings:
‚úÖ **Only 1 component had the issue** - NewCustomerForm.js (fixed in task #32)
‚úÖ **All other components already correct** - ExistingCustomerLogin and ConfirmCustomerInfo
‚úÖ **All backend endpoints correctly expect clean digits** - No backend changes needed
‚úÖ **Database design is correct** - Stores clean digits only
‚úÖ **Phone masking is UI-only** - For better user experience

### Summary:
The phone number masking issue was isolated to **NewCustomerForm.js only**. All other parts of the application were already handling phone numbers correctly. The fix applied in task #32 ensures consistent phone number storage throughout the entire system.

**PHONE NUMBER HANDLING: FULLY AUDITED AND VERIFIED! ‚úì**
